"""
Custom exceptions raised by the EQL verbalization subsystem.

Each is a :class:`~krrood.exceptions.DataclassException` — a dataclass exception that carries the
structured cause as fields and builds its human-readable ``message`` in ``__post_init__`` — so the
failure data is inspectable (not only a formatted string), consistent with the rest of krrood.
