"""
The HSR throws the milk away in the SuTuRo lab of
:class:`~semantic_digital_twin.predefined_maps.kitchen_environment.KitchenEnvironment`:
it takes the milk from the kitchen counter top, carries it to the trash can and lets go
of it above the trash can's opening.

Runs in simulation, so nothing on the network is needed. The scaffolding in
:mod:`coraplex.demonstrations` owns the ROS session and publishes the world to Rviz, so
the run can be watched while it happens.

The pick-up leaves the grasp and the standing pose open: each pair is tried out before
it is executed, and the first that succeeds is taken. At the trash can the robot stands
in front of its open side, facing it, and holds the milk turned the way it took it.

.. note:: A kinematically simulated world has no gravity, so there the milk stays where
    it is let go, above the trash can.

While the plan runs, SegMind segments it into the grasps, pick-ups, placings and
containments of the milk, and reports them once the plan is done.
